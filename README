This is version 1.50 of the perl NDF module
-------------------------------------------

The extensible N-dimensional data format (NDF) is a format for storing
bulk data in the form of N-dimensional arrays of numbers. It is
typically used for storing spectra, images and similar datasets with
higher dimensionality. The NDF format is based on the Hierarchical
Data System (HDS) and is extensible; not only does it provide a 
comprehensive set of standard ancillary items to describe the data,
it can also be extended indefinitely to handle additional user-defined
information of any type.

NDF is the data format of choice for software distributed by the
Starlink Project (Rutherford Appleton Laboratory,
http://star-www.rl.ac.uk/). It is widely used in the United Kingdom
astronomical community (for example in the Figaro data reduction
package).

This module provides a perl interface to the Fortran NDF libraries
that are supplied with the standard Starlink software distribution.

PDL
---

A module is provided for reading and writing NDF files via
the perl data language (PDL). The module is called PDL::IO::NDF
and can manipulate data from NDF files whilst keeping 
any NDF extensions intact.

The PDL module requires at least v1.99 of perldl.
The PDL home page can be found at http://pdl.perl.org/
