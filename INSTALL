Installation instructions for the perl NDF module
-------------------------------------------------

Requirements
------------

This module has been tested with perl5.003 and 5.004 but should work with
perl5.002.

The Starlink NDF library distribution (version 1.3 or higher) must be
available.  The NDF library (libndf.a) is dependent on many other
libraries in the Starlink distribution. If you have the Starlink
software collection all these libraries should be available.

As of 5th November 1996, the following libraries are required in order
to use the NDF module (via the Starlink ndf_link command):

-lndf -lpsx -lary -lhds -lcnf -lerr -lerr_standalone -lems -lchr -lprm -lprm_a

It is also necessary to have dat_par.h and sae_par.h. Optionally
this software can use err_err.h, ems_err.h and msg_par.h if they
are installed.

Luckily Starlink distribute ALL necessary libraries in one package if
the NDF library is requested. Pre-built libraries can be obtained for
Linux.

If you wish to use the PDL::IO::NDF extension you will also need PDL,
available from CPAN. The PDL module works with version 1.11 of Perl DL.



Building and Installation
-------------------------

0) Read the associated machine-dependent README file (README.linux)
   for known problems on your architecture.

1) If the optional Starlink include files are available then you may want
   to remove the comments from NDF.xs.

2) Edit Build.PL.
	Build.PL should work for Linux.

   You may need to edit the location of the Starlink include files
   if they are not in the standard location ($starinc). 


3) Installation should now be a case of:

	% perl Build.PL
	% ./Build
	% ./Build test
	% ./Build install

Using the array packing code
----------------------------

It is also possible to link the array handling code separately. This may 
be necessary if you wish to use this code yourself or if you are trying
to compile a perl program which includes two modules that use the same
array handling code.

To do this the following is necessary:

	% cd arrays
	% make

This will create libarrays.a. You must then uncomment the libarrays line
in Build.PL and comment out the '#include "arrays/arrays.c"' line in
NDF.xs.
