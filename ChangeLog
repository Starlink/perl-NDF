	* NDF.xs: Add status checking before using unpack1D and array
	functions since if status returns bad the counter variables (eg
	el) may be set incorrectly and cause segmentation faults when
	trying to unpack arrays.

	* NDF.pm (par_get): Add support for monolith parameters. Simplify
	the logic concerning $ADAM_USER and make -w clean.

	* NDF.xs: Improve DAT__ROOT, DAT__NOLOC routines so that gcc
	doesn't complain about pointer mismatch

	* NDF.xs: Use PREINIT for declaring variables in an XS routine.

1998-02-13  Tim Jenness  <timj@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* NDF.xs: Add ndf_size (somehow this had been left out earlier)

	* NDF.pm (par_get): Fix the use of ADAM_USER in par_get.
